A basic plugin that can enforce quantity limits for products in WooCommerce Orders.

== Description ==

This plugin came out of a use-case of a shop owner who wanted to be able to impose quantity limits when ordering certain products 
on his online WooCommerce shop.

Enter Restrict Stock for WooCommerce - a very small, simple, and lightweight plugin that can do just that. Upon installation, two new fields 
will be added to the _Product > Inventory_ interface for all products called "Quantity to restrict," and "Restriction Notes." The number 
entered into the "Quantity to restrict" field is the maximum number of this product that a customer can purchase in one order. The 
"Restriction Notes" field holds the custom error message that will be shown when a customer tries to add more than the allowed number of 
this product into their cart.
